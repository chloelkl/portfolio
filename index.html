          <h2>Sustainify</h2>
          <p class="projdesc">
            Our team aimed to promote sustainability through a web application that leverages influence and incentives. 
            I was responsible for the challenge management aspect of the web app. 
            To achieve this, I developed the front-end using React and MUI and managed the back-end with Express and Node.js.
            <br><br>
            Drawing from my experience with previous projects, I also guided team members who were less familiar with GitHub. 
            I took the initiative to start building the client side of the app, ensuring that the development process was smooth and efficient. 
            As a result, the project successfully created an engaging platform that encourages sustainable practices, 
            and my leadership helped the team become more proficient with GitHub, leading to better collaboration and development outcomes.

          <h2>EduTecx</h2>
          <p class="projdesc">
            EduTecx revolutionizes learning by digitizing textbooks using Python Flask. 
            This project was thought out by me, and together with my team, we developed and enhanced it. 
            My primary focus was on the classroom management system.
            <br><br>
            This project marked my first experience using GitHub for team collaboration. 
            Although it was challenging for many of us due to the multitude of new concepts we had to grasp simultaneously, 
            we learned the value of teamwork and supported each other throughout the process.

          <h2>Chloe Crochets</h2>
          <p class="projdesc">
            One of my favorite individual web development projects combined my crocheting hobby with my technical skills. 
            I aimed to create a website for my crochet blogs, information, and commissions using pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the EmailJS library. 
            <br><br>
            I experimented with multiple animations to make the website lively and engaging, and integrated EmailJS to facilitate user interaction and notifications. 
            The result was a vibrant and interactive website that effectively showcased my crochet work and allowed users to engage with me seamlessly, 
            enhancing the overall user experience and helping me connect better with my audience.
          </p>

          <h2>SIDETrack</h2>
          <p class="projdesc">
            Built for a hackathon focused on Toxic Productivity, SIDETrack is a platform designed to help users manage their time and provide emotional support. 
            This project was a collaborative effort with two friends and two new teammates from Canada. 
            <br><br>
            Despite facing multiple challenges, such as the drastic time difference and all of us being amateur developers, 
            I took the initiative to lead the team through these difficulties. Our perseverance paid off, and we achieved an honorable mention.

          <h2>Frogbot</h2>
          <p class="projdesc">
            Using Autocode, I created my own Discord bot with JavaScript, marking my first experience using JavaScript for an application beyond websites. 
            <br><br>
            My bot responded to commands for games and cheeky pickup lines, fostering a more fun environment on Discord servers. 
            I implemented games like word scramble and utilized persistent storage to keep track of points users earned when they won. 
            This project allowed me to explore and experiment with the diverse applications JavaScript can offer.
