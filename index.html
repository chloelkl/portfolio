          I'm Chloe Low, a graduate of Nanyang Polytechnic with a Diploma in Information Technology.
          Fuelled by creativity and technology, I strive to take advantage of IoTs to make
          the world more fun and interesting.

          <h2>Sustainify (under development)</h2>
          <p class="projdesc">
            Our team aims to promote sustainability through a web application that leverages influence and incentives. 
            I am currently responsible for the challenge management aspect of the web app. 
            To achieve this, I am developing the front-end using React and MUI and managing the back-end with Express and Node.js.
            <br><br>
            Drawing from my experience with previous projects, I am also guiding team members who are less familiar with GitHub. 
            I took the initiative to start building the client side of the app, ensuring that the development process is smooth and efficient. 
            As a result, my entire team is able to confidently pull and push codes through GitHub and successfully integrate one another's work.
            I take pride in being able to help my team better collaborate and communicate.

          <p class="projdesc">
            EduTecx revolutionises learning by digitising textbooks using Python Flask. 
            This project was thought out by me, and together with my team, we developed and enhanced it. 
            My primary focus was on the classroom management system.
            <br><br>
            This project marked my first experience using GitHub for team collaboration. 
            Although it was challenging for many of us due to the multitude of new concepts we had to grasp simultaneously, 
            we learned the value of teamwork and supported each other throughout the process, which led to a grade A for this project.

          <h2>Chloe Crochets</h2>
          <p class="projdesc">
            This is one of my favorite individual web development projects as it combined my crocheting hobby with my technical skills. 
            I created a website for my crochet blogs, information, and commissions using pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the EmailJS library. 
            <br><br>
            I experimented with multiple animations to make the website lively and engaging, and integrated EmailJS to facilitate user interaction and notifications. 
            The result was a vibrant and interactive website that effectively showcased my crochet work and allowed users to engage with me seamlessly, 
            enhancing the overall user experience and helping me connect better with my audience.

          <h2>SIDETrack</h2>
          <p class="projdesc">
            Built for a hackathon focused on Toxic Productivity, SIDETrack is a platform designed to help users manage their time and provide emotional support. 
            This project was a collaborative effort with two friends and two new teammates from Canada. 
            <br><br>
            Despite facing multiple challenges, such as the drastic time difference and all of us being amateur developers, 
            I took the initiative to lead the team through these difficulties. Our perseverance paid off, and we achieved an honorable mention.

          <h2>Frogbot</h2>
          <p class="projdesc">
            Using Autocode, I created my own Discord bot with JavaScript, marking my first experience using JavaScript for an application beyond websites. 
            <br><br>
            My bot responded to commands for games and cheeky pickup lines, fostering a more fun environment on Discord servers. 
            I implemented games like word scramble and utilised persistent storage to keep track of points users earned when they won. 
            This project allowed me to explore and experiment with the diverse applications JavaScript can offer.

          <h2>Kidnaped Roblox Escape Room</h2>
          <p class="projdesc">
            I proposed this RobloxStudio project during my Secondary 2 holidays to my friend, as game development sparked an interest in both of us. 
            Our goal was to design and build an escape room experience that would not only captivate players, 
            but also allow us to utilise Roblox Studio and scripting in Lua to experiment with coding and development as complete amateurs.
            <br><br>
            I took the lead in designing the layout of the escape room. We collaborated closely throughout the development process, 
            overcoming numerous bugs and technical challenges by supporting each other and troubleshooting together. 
            Our efforts led to our game accumulating over 170,000 visits to date. This project not only provided a sense of accomplishment, 
            but also significantly fueled our interest in programming and game development.
