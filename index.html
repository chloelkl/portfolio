        <p>
          I'm Chloe Low, a student of Nanyang Polytechnic undertaking a Diploma in Information Technology.
          Fuelled by creativity and technology, I strive to take advantage of the power of code to make
          the world more fun and interesting.

          <h2>Work Pass Integrated System</h2>
          <p class="projdesc">
            For my final year of polytechnic, I joined Govtech as part of my one-year Internship Programme, attached to Ministry of Manpower.
            I had the opportunity to work on WINS Work Permit form, which replaces the legacy Work Permit Online system, handling millions of transactions a year.
            <br><br>
            Being able to experience a real-world industry project has taught me more than any lecture could. 
            From building features under Large-Scale Scrum to production support to facilitating team and GovTech-wide events, 
            this project has enabled me to make a real difference to Singapore's workforce and deepen my knowledge and passion in software development.

          <h2>Vegeatery</h2>
          <p class="projdesc">
            Vegeatery is an eatery dedicated to promoting sustainbality through healthy and vegetarian diets. 
            We aim to develop a web app that streamlines the F&B process. I undertook the reservation section, designing the UI using Figma and developing the 
            features with .NET and ReactJS with MUI. 
            I focused on designing a unique reservation page that is intuitive, giving users freedom and control over their bookings.
            <br><br>
            To enhance our development workflow, we optimised our use of GitHub, ensuring frequent and efficient branch merging. 
            This approach fostered strong teamwork, making integration not just smoother but also an unexpectedly enjoyable part of the project.

          <p class="projdesc">
            Our team aims to promote sustainability through a web application that leverages influence and incentives. 
            I was responsible for the challenge management aspect of the web app. 
            To achieve this, I developed the front-end using React and MUI and managed the back-end with Express and Node.js.
            <br><br>
            Drawing from my experience with previous projects, I guided team members who are less familiar with GitHub. 
            I took the initiative to start building the client side of the app, ensuring that the development process is smooth and efficient. 
            As a result, my entire team was able to confidently pull and push codes through GitHub and successfully integrate one another's work.
            I take pride in being able to help my team better collaborate and communicate, and through my hard work I achieved a distinction.

            EduTecx revolutionises learning by digitising textbooks using Python Flask. 
            This project was thought out by me, and together with my team, we developed and enhanced it. 
            My primary focus was on the classroom management system.
            <br><br>
            This project marked my first experience using GitHub for team collaboration. 
            Although it was challenging for many of us due to the multitude of new concepts we had to grasp simultaneously, 
            we learned the value of teamwork and supported each other throughout the process, which led to a grade A for this project.

          <h2>Chloe Crochets</h2>
          <p class="projdesc">
            This is one of my favorite individual web development projects as it combined my crocheting hobby with my technical skills. 
            I created a website for my crochet blogs, information, and commissions using pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the EmailJS library. 
            <br><br>
            I experimented with multiple animations to make the website lively and engaging, and integrated EmailJS to facilitate user interaction and notifications. 
            The result was a vibrant and interactive website that effectively showcased my crochet work and allowed users to engage with me seamlessly, 
            enhancing the overall user experience and helping me connect better with my audience.

          <p class="projdesc">
            Using Autocode, I created my own Discord bot with JavaScript, marking my first experience using JavaScript for an application beyond websites. 
            <br><br>
            My bot responded to commands for games and cheeky pickup lines, fostering a more fun environment on Discord servers. 
            I implemented games like word scramble and utilised persistent storage to keep track of points users earned when they won. 
            This project allowed me to explore and experiment with the diverse applications JavaScript can offer.

          <h2>Kidnaped Roblox Escape Room</h2>
          <p class="projdesc">
            I proposed this RobloxStudio project during my Secondary 2 holidays to my friend, as game development sparked an interest in both of us. 
            Our goal was to design and build an escape room experience that would not only captivate players, 
            but also allow us to utilise Roblox Studio and scripting in Lua to experiment with coding and development as complete amateurs.
            <br><br>
            I took the lead in designing the layout of the escape room. We collaborated closely throughout the development process, 
            overcoming numerous bugs and technical challenges by supporting each other and troubleshooting together. 
            Our efforts led to our game accumulating over 170,000 visits to date. This project not only provided a sense of accomplishment, 
            but also significantly fueled our interest in programming and game development.

            Hosted by Global Green Economic Foundation, our aim was to come up with a solution that fulfils SDG3 - Good Health & Well-being. 
            I worked with four of my peers using design thinking to propose "Ocean Eyes", a mobile app designed to provide users with a safe space to log their emotions and seek support.
            <br><br>
            My team achieved 3rd place NYP-wide, allowing us to move on to compete in the Grand Finals, where we worked closely with mentors make the 
            best of our ideas. Though we did not place in the Grand Finals, working with my team and the connections made has given us more than valuable insights
            about the sustainability industry and its importance, and I am extremely proud of how far we had come.

            I participated in the PolyFinTech100 API Hackathon, representing Nanyang Polytechnic under PayPal’s theme of reducing elderly scams. 
            Beyond developing a user-friendly Figma UI, I took a creative approach to our presentation by incorporating an engaging skit to effectively communicate our solution.
            <br><br>
            This experience allowed me to observe top presentations from other schools, gaining valuable insights into innovative fintech solutions and storytelling techniques. 
            It was an opportunity to refine my design and pitching skills while tackling a meaningful problem in financial security.

            This project was a collaborative effort with two friends and two new teammates from Canada.

            Despite facing multiple challenges, such as the drastic time difference and all of us being amateur developers, 
            I took the initiative to lead the team through these difficulties. Our perseverance paid off, and we achieved an honorable mention.
